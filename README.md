2) Clonal RElatedness of two pair of tumours using EM algorithm



##### This project applied the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to tackle key challenges in genetics, particularly in estimating allele frequencies for the ABO blood group system and enhancing clonal relatedness estimates in cancer research. The ABO blood group system, a cornerstone of human genetics, serves as an ideal model for population genetic studies. However, incomplete or missing data often complicate the accurate estimation of allele frequencies. The EM algorithm, renowned for its iterative approach in handling missing data, was employed to overcome these challenges. This allowed for more accurate and efficient allele frequency estimations from available datasets, providing insights into genetic inheritance patterns and population dynamics.

##### In the context of cancer research, the project expanded the use of the EM algorithm to estimate clonal relatedness in cancer cells. Understanding clonal evolution is essential for unraveling tumor progression, drug resistance, and the heterogeneity of cancer. The EM algorithm facilitated more precise estimations of clonal structures, enabling researchers to track mutations and genetic variations within tumors. These estimations are pivotal for advancing personalized cancer therapies and understanding disease mechanisms at a molecular level.

##### Through this project, the EM algorithm proved instrumental in improving the precision of genetic data analysis, contributing to both the field of population genetics and the evolving landscape of cancer research. The findings offer practical applications in personalized medicine, genetic risk assessments, and targeted cancer treatment strategies.Ted cancer treatment strategies.
